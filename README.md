`cmpsh` is a lightweight, Unix-compatible shell written in C. It demonstrates fundamental operating system concepts including process management (`fork`/`exec`), inter-process communication (pipes), I/O redirection, and signal handling.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Shell Functionality

- **Interactive & Non-interactive Modes**: Use it as a command-line prompt or to execute shell scripts.
- **Process Management**: Executes external commands using the `fork`/`exec` model.
- **Piping**: Chains multiple commands together, feeding the output of one into the input of the next.
- **I/O Redirection**: Redirects standard output from commands to files.
- **Signal Handling**: Gracefully handles `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTSTP` (Ctrl+Z) without terminating the shell.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for syntax, file, and process-related issues.

### Enhanced Built-in Commands

- **help**: Comprehensive help system showing all commands and features
- **env**: Display all environment variables
- **history**: Command history tracking and display (up to 100 commands)
- **alias**: Create and manage command aliases
- **exit**, **cd**, **pwd**, **path**: Essential navigation and system commands

### Advanced Features

- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Support for `$VAR` and `${VAR}` syntax
- **Tilde Expansion**: Support for `~` and `~user` home directory expansion
- **Command History**: Persistent history with numbered display
- **Alias System**: Create shortcuts for frequently used commands
- **Enhanced Search Paths**: Smart executable discovery across system directories

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started, clone the repository, build the project, and run the shell.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/KarimmYasser/cmpsh.git](https://github.com/KarimmYasser/cmpsh.git)

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd cmpsh

# 3. Build the project (creates build/cmpsh)
make all

# 4. Run tests to verify everything works
make test

# 5. Run the shell interactively
./build/cmpsh

# 6. View all available build targets
make help
```

## 📖 Usage

### Built-in Commands

`cmpsh` supports the following built-in commands:

| Command          | Description                                     | Example              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `help`           | Display help information and available commands | `help`               |
| `env`            | Show all environment variables                  | `env`                |
| `history`        | Display command history                         | `history`            |
| `alias`          | Create or display command aliases               | `alias ll "ls -l"`   |
| `exit`           | Exit the shell                                  | `exit`               |
| `cd <directory>` | Change the current working directory            | `cd /home/user`      |
| `pwd`            | Print the current working directory             | `pwd`                |
| `path <paths>`   | Set executable search paths                     | `path /bin /usr/bin` |
| `exit`           | Terminates the shell.                           | `exit`               |

_Note: Calling `path` with no arguments clears all search paths._

### External Command Execution

Execute any command available on your system. The shell searches for the executable in the directories specified by the `path` variable (the initial default is `/bin`).

```bash
cmpsh> ls -la
cmpsh> grep "pattern" file.txt
cmpsh> date
```

### Piping Support

Chain multiple commands together using the pipe `|` operator.

```bash
cmpsh> ls -la | grep ".txt"
cmpsh> cat file.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

### I/O Redirection

Redirect the standard output of a command to a file using the `>` operator.

```bash
cmpsh> ls -la > directory_listing.txt
cmpsh> echo "Hello World" > greeting.txt
```

### Enhanced Features Examples

```bash
# Command history
cmpsh> ls -la
cmpsh> pwd
cmpsh> history
  1  ls -la
  2  pwd
  3  history

# Environment variable expansion
cmpsh> echo "Home: $HOME"
Home: /home/user
cmpsh> echo "Current dir: $PWD"
Current dir: /home/user/cmpsh

# Alias system
cmpsh> alias ll "ls -l"
Alias 'll' set to 'ls -l'
cmpsh> ll
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1234 Sep 27 21:00 file.txt

# Comprehensive help
cmpsh> help
cmpsh - Custom Shell Implementation
Built-in commands:
  exit        - Exit the shell
  cd <dir>    - Change directory
  [... full help output ...]
```

### Script Execution (Non-Interactive Mode)

`cmpsh` can execute commands from a script file.

```bash
# Create a script file (e.g., my_script.sh)
echo "pwd" > my_script.sh
echo "ls -la > output.txt" >> my_script.sh

# Run the script
./build/cmpsh my_script.sh
```

## 🔧 Building and Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- `make` utility
- A POSIX-compliant system (Linux, macOS, WSL)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Standard build (creates 'build/cmpsh' executable)
make all

# Debug build with sanitizers
make debug

# Release build (optimized)
make release

# Clean all build artifacts
make clean

# Development workflow (clean + build + test)
make dev

# Optional: Install the executable to /usr/local/bin
sudo make install
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test suite is included to verify the shell's functionality.

```bash
# Run the entire test suite
make test

# Or run directly
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

The tests cover:

- Built-in command functionality
- External command execution
- Piping and redirection
- Error handling scenarios

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The shell processes commands through a simple pipeline:

**Input → Parser → Built-in Check → External Command Execution → Wait for Completion**

### System Calls Used

- **Process Management**: `fork()`, `execv()`, `wait()`, `waitpid()`
- **File Operations**: `open()`, `close()`, `dup2()`, `access()`
- **Directory Operations**: `chdir()`, `getcwd()`
- **Inter-Process Communication**: `pipe()`
- **Signal Handling**: `signal()`, `kill()`
